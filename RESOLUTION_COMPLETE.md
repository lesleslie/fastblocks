# ✅ Pre-commit Hook Failures: RESOLVED

**Issue**: Complexipy and Creosote hook failures
**Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Time to Resolution**: ~15 minutes

______________________________________________________________________

## Summary

Both pre-commit hook failures have been successfully diagnosed and fixed:

1. **Complexipy (Cognitive Complexity)**: ✅ PASSED

   - Refactored `validate_template_context` function
   - Complexity reduced from 17 → 8 (53% reduction)
   - Three helper functions extracted

1. **Creosote (Unused Dependencies)**: ✅ PASSED

   - Removed unused `urllib3` direct dependency
   - Remains available as transitive dependency
   - No functional impact

______________________________________________________________________

## Verification

```bash
$ pre-commit run complexipy --all-files --hook-stage manual
complexipy...............................................................Passed

$ pre-commit run creosote --all-files --hook-stage manual
creosote.................................................................Passed
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Refactoring

**File**: `fastblocks/_validation_integration.py`

Added three helper functions:

- `_extract_template_context()` - Lines 703-710
- `_log_template_validation_errors()` - Lines 713-727
- `_update_context_in_args()` - Lines 730-740

Refactored:

- `validate_template_context()` - Lines 743-791

### 2. Dependency Cleanup

**File**: `pyproject.toml`

Removed:

- `urllib3>=2.5.0` (direct dependency)

**Reason**: FastBlocks uses Python's standard library `urllib.parse` and `urllib.request`, not the third-party `urllib3` package. It remains available as a transitive dependency through `httpx` and `sentry-sdk`.

## Root Causes Explained

### Complexipy: Why 17 was too complex

The original decorator had too many responsibilities in a single function:

- Extracting arguments from multiple sources (kwargs vs args)
- Type checking and validation
- Conditional logging with nested exception handling
- Updating arguments in two different ways (kwargs vs args)

**Solution**: Extracted each responsibility into its own helper function, reducing branching in the main logic.

### Creosote: Why urllib3 was flagged

FastBlocks code uses:

- `urllib.parse.quote` (standard library)
- `urllib.parse.urljoin` (standard library)
- `urllib.request.parse_http_list` (standard library)

These are **NOT** the same as the third-party `urllib3` package. The `urllib3` dependency was added incorrectly at some point, possibly due to confusion between the standard library modules and the package name.

## About the Rust Panic

During investigation, you may have seen:

```
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

This was **NOT the actual problem**. This panic:

- Only occurs when using `complexipy --output-json` flag
- Is a bug in complexipy v4.2.0's JSON export feature
- Does NOT affect the normal operation of the tool
- Does NOT affect pre-commit hooks (which don't use --output-json)

The real issue was the legitimate complexity violation (17 > 15), which was correctly detected and reported by the tool.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. ✅ Run full test suite: `python -m pytest -v`
1. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message
1. Consider running crackerjack verification: `python -m crackerjack -t --ai-fix`

### Suggested Commit Message

```
fix(validation): reduce complexity and remove unused dependency

- Refactor validate_template_context decorator to reduce cognitive complexity from 17 to 8
- Extract three helper functions for better separation of concerns
- Remove unused urllib3 direct dependency (kept as transitive dep)
- Fix pre-commit hook failures for complexipy and creosote

Fixes: complexipy hook failure (complexity 17 > 15)
Fixes: creosote hook failure (unused urllib3)
```
